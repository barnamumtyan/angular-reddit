# Angular Reddit #

This is a reddit reader angular application where I use best practices that I picked up while learning front-end development.
It is not a complete application yet, and still missing some important features, but if you want to learn a few best practices on how to build an angular app
you're welcome to check it out :smile:.

## How to run ##
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/barnamumtyan/angular-reddit.git
    $ cd angular-reddit
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ gulp serve
```

## Some of the sources (that come to mind at the moment :smile:) where I have been inspired from: ##
  - [John Papa's blog](http://www.johnpapa.net/) <- [general style guide for writing angular code](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)
  - [Todd Motto's blog](http://toddmotto.com/) <- [using the extend function to interface with templates)](http://toddmotto.com/a-better-way-to-scope-angular-extend-no-more-vm-this/)
  - [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) <- [morphing elements](http://tympanus.net/Development/ButtonComponentMorph/)

## What's next ##
I will keep adding features and refactoring, when I learn something interesting.
Stuff todo:
  - [ ] Proper error handling
  - [ ] Morphing element animations
  - [ ] Write tests
  - [ ] Write docs
